## Deep Learning Labs

### Lab 1

#### • Use youtube-dl to download clean speech
#### • Similarly find pure noise. e.g. car noise, coffee noise
#### • Mix the two (use sox)
#### • Train a single layer LMS and neural network type algorithm to predict next value from N past values

### Lab 2

#### • Generate training set and distinct dev and test sets
#### • Use feature extraction, signal reconstruction framework
#### • Perform either speech activity detection or denoising or both

### Lab 3

#### • Train a classifier to detect the phoneme every frame
#### • Extract features
#### • Use feed-forward network
#### • Use one speaker for training and test on same speaker and another provided speaker

### Lab 4

#### • Build GMMs from EM and Neural Nets
####   • GMM EM: Expectation Maximization is used to build a Gaussian Mixture Model
####   • GMM Neural Net: Autoencoder is used to build a Gaussian Mixture Model
#### • Use Kaldi to create FSTs from Phoneme detection
